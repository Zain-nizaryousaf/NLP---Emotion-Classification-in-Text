# NLP---Emotion-Classification-in-Text
This project focuses on developing machine learning models to classify emotions in text samples using a labeled dataset. It includes data preprocessing, feature extraction with TF-IDF, and training of Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine models. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy and F1-score are used to assess model performance.

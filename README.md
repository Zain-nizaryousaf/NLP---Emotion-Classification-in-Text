# Emotion Classification in Text Samples

## Overview
This project aims to develop machine learning models for classifying emotions in text samples. We will employ various preprocessing techniques, feature extraction methods, and machine learning models to achieve the classification task.

## Objective
The objective of this assessment is to create and evaluate machine learning models to classify emotions in text, focusing on preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Emotion Dataset
- **Content:** Text samples labeled with corresponding emotions.

## Key Components

### 1. Loading and Preprocessing 
In this section, the dataset is loaded and preprocessed. The preprocessing steps include text cleaning, tokenization, and removal of stopwords.

**Preprocessing Techniques:**
- **Text Cleaning:** Removing punctuation, special characters, and numbers to retain only relevant words.
- **Tokenization:** Splitting the cleaned text into individual words (tokens).
- **Stopword Removal:** Eliminating common words (e.g., "and", "the") that do not contribute significantly to the meaning of the text.

### 2. Feature Extraction 
For feature extraction, we will use **TfidfVectorizer**. This method transforms the text data into numerical features by calculating the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) for each word, reflecting its importance relative to the entire corpus.

### 3. Model Development 
We will train the following machine learning models:
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

### 4. Model Comparison 
We will evaluate both models using metrics such as accuracy and F1-score to assess their performance in emotion classification.

### 5. Conclusion
In this project, we implemented preprocessing techniques, feature extraction using TF-IDF, and trained both Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine models for emotion classification. The evaluation metrics provide insights into the performance of each model.
